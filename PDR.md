# Deployment Instructions for React + FastAPI Azure Solution

This guide outlines how to deploy a solution with a React front-end and a FastAPI back-end on Azure. The architecture leverages Azure Static Web Apps for the front-end, Azure App Service for the API, and integrates with Azure Active Directory for authentication. Optional services include Azure Files for shared storage and Azure AI Foundry for AI capabilities.

---

## Prerequisites
- An active [Azure account](https://azure.microsoft.com/).
- [Azure CLI](https://docs.microsoft.com/cli/azure/install-azure-cli) installed.
- Source code for your React app and FastAPI backend.
- A GitHub repository (or Azure DevOps) for CI/CD.

## Step 1: Provision Azure Resources

### 1.1 Azure Static Web Apps (React Front-End)
- **Create Resource:**  
  - In the Azure Portal, create a new Static Web App.
- **Connect Repository:**  
  - Link it to your GitHub repository containing the React code.
- **Configuration:**  
  - Set the app location (e.g., `/` or `/src`) and build command (e.g., `npm run build`).
- **Deployment:**  
  - The service will automatically build and deploy your static files globally.

### 1.2 Azure App Service (FastAPI Back-End)
- **Create Resource:**  
  - In the Azure Portal, create a new App Service for a Python application.
- **Runtime Setup:**  
  - Choose the appropriate Python version.
- **Deployment Options:**  
  - Deploy via GitHub Actions, Azure DevOps, or ZIP deploy.
- **Settings:**  
  - Configure environment variables and any necessary application settings.

### 1.3 Azure Active Directory (Authentication)
- **Register Application:**  
  - In the Azure AD portal, register your application.
- **Configure Authentication:**  
  - Set up user sign-in and access controls for both the front-end and back-end.
- **Optional:**  
  - For external users, consider using Azure AD B2C.

### 1.4 Optional Services

#### Azure Files (Shared Storage)
- **Create File Share:**  
  - Set up an Azure Storage account and create an Azure Files share.
- **Integration:**  
  - Configure your FastAPI backend to use this share for file storage as needed.

#### Azure AI Foundry (AI/ML Capabilities)
- **Set Up Workspace:**  
  - If your app requires AI or ML features, provision an Azure Machine Learning workspace or Cognitive Services.
- **Integration:**  
  - Connect your FastAPI endpoints to your AI services for tasks like predictions or data analysis.

## Step 2: Establish CI/CD Pipelines

### 2.1 Front-End Deployment (Static Web Apps)
- **Automated Builds:**  
  - Commit changes to your GitHub repository. The Azure Static Web Apps service will automatically trigger a build and deploy the React application.
- **Monitoring:**  
  - Review deployment logs via the Azure Portal.

### 2.2 Back-End Deployment (App Service)
- **Deploy FastAPI:**  
  - Use your chosen method (GitHub Actions, Azure DevOps, ZIP deploy) to push the FastAPI code to the App Service.
- **Verification:**  
  - Access the App Service URL to ensure your API endpoints are running correctly.

---

## Step 3: Testing & Post-Deployment

1. **Front-End Testing:**  
   - Navigate the React dashboard via the Static Web App URL.
2. **API Testing:**  
   - Validate API calls from the front-end to the FastAPI back-end.
3. **Authentication Check:**  
   - Ensure Azure AD sign-in and security flows are working as expected.
4. **Monitoring & Scaling:**  
   - Use Azure Monitor and App Service scaling settings to manage performance and resource usage.

---

## Step 4: Maintenance & Updates

- **Continuous Deployment:**  
  - Push code changes to your repository to trigger automatic deployments.
- **Resource Optimization:**  
  - Regularly review and adjust resource configurations based on app performance and user load.
- **Security:**  
  - Update authentication and access policies as needed to keep your application secure.
